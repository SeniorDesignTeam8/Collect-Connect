Down in Ann Arbor Town

This lively "pictorial map" of the University of Michigan's home town is meant more for amusement than navigation. Various University customs, characters, and locales are drawn in playful caricature. The "Union Opera," the "Sophomore Circus," and "Freshman Girls Picnic" are just a few of the depicted hallmarks of undergraduate life from 100 years ago.
