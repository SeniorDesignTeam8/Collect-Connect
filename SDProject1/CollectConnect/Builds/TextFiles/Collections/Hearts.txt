Four of Hearts
Charming & charismatic, the Four of Hearts is a "people person" whose deep fulfillment comes from satisfying, close relationships both at home & at work. A natural empath, they're highly attuned to the emotional climate around them & tend to address the needs of others before their own. They're lovingly devoted & dedicated to others as a unique expression of their card.

Five of Hearts
"Variety's the spice of life" could be the motto of the Five of Hearts person. They're the seeker of all things new & different: ideas, careers, foreign lands, & lovers. With so much Three energy in their chart (the Three of Clubs in Mercury & the Three of Spades in Venus), they have a hard time deciding if this is all there is to life as they rush toward the next adventure. Even for those who are settled in their life, career, or marriage, they're likely to have a file folder of travel & vacation ideas or a strong fantasy life where they can live freely & without consequence.

Six of Hearts
There's a deep need for a Six of Hearts person to express themselves from their heart. Perhaps more than the other Sixes, they have a choice to be responsible with their emotional expression or be irresponsible. Irresponsibility is often met quickly with consequences, but the choice is ultimately theirs to make. When fair & peace-loving, they prefer a stable emotional life & focus their energy on developing balanced relationships. When avoidant, stubborn, or unfair, they may find themselves in rutted relationships that are ultimately unsatisfying or directionless.

Nine of Hearts
As the alternating Semi-Fixed Card (often called a Soul Twin) with the Seven of Diamonds, the Nine of Hearts holds only two positions: the Saturn/Saturn position & the Venus/Venus position in both Master Scripts (Spiritual & Life). Due to this "semi-fixed" nature, the influences on this card are always imbued with either double Venus or double Saturn energies throughout their life.
